TERMINAL BASICS EXERCISE

1. Create a new directory/folder called "Marvel"
2. Inside "Marvel" add 2 directories/folders: "Avengers" and "Villians"
3. Inside "Avengers" create these files: "captainAmerica.txt", "blackWidow.txt", "ironMan.txt, and "happy.txt"
4. Create a new directory/folder inside "Avengers" called "moreAvengers"
5. Inside "moreAvengers" create these files: "falcon.txt", "doctorStrange.txt", and "blackPanther.txt"
6. Get to the "Villians" directory/folder and create these files: "thanos.txt", "ultron.txt", "loki.txt" inside of it
7. You decide Happy is not actually an Avenger. Remove the "happy.txt" file.
8. Uh oh, Thanos snapped his fingers and now Falcon, Doctor Strange, and Black Panther are gone! Delete the "moreAvengers" directory/folder.

BONUS: Try to complete using the fewest commands lines as possible (Basically fewest times hitting enter)
